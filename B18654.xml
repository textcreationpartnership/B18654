            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CASE OF THE Company of Merchant-Adventurers for the Discovery of New Trades, commonly called, <hi>The</hi> Russia-<hi>Company.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <hi>SHEWETH,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THAT they were Incorporated in the First and Second Year of the Reign of <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> and confirmed by Act of Parliament in the Eighth Year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That they have ever since continued the same, without having given any just cause of Complaint in Parliament, or elsewhere.</p>
            <p>That they do continue and increase their Succession by Patrimony and Service, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting into the Freedom of the said Company the Sons of Freemen, and those that have served Apprenticeships to the Freemen of the said Company.</p>
            <p>That the said Company (contrary to the false Suggestions of the Merchants Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners against them) have since the Grant of their Charter been at vast Charges in fitting out great Numbers of Ships for the Discovery of New Countries and Isles, with good Success, as will at large appear by the Journals kept by their Commanders in the said Voyages, which they have to produce to the Honourable House; and of all the vast Discoveries they have made both before and after the Grant of the said Charter: Their Zeal for the General Good and Increase of the Trade of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hath prevailed with them to reserve to themselves (exempt from all others) only the Trade of <hi>Russia,</hi> and that not wholly, they permitting all Merchants to Export from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Narve</hi> all Goods whatsoever, without paying any Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment; and but One <hi>Per Cent.</hi> for the License (according to the Value in the Book of Rates) on what Goods of the growth of <hi>Russia</hi> only, that they Import to <hi>England</hi> from the said <hi>Narve;</hi> a Port nearer the Imperial City of <hi>Mosco,</hi> than <hi>Arch-Angel,</hi> the other Port to it, which is all they reserve entirely to themselves; where (contrary to the false suggestions of the Merchants Petitioners against them) they drive more than a full Trade, yearly sending thither Cloth, and other Goods and Manufactures of this Kingdom, and of our Plantations, than will vend; There al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways remaining great quantities of their said Goods unsold, as doth in <hi>England</hi> of the Goods they Import from thence, notwithstanding they Re-ship many of them for Foreign Parts; which they humbly hope may sufficiently evince that they drive the Trade to the full; and that their Vigilance for Enlarging it hath not been wanting, they having of late years much Increased it, from Three or Four Ships a Year to more than Treble that Number in some years; and which they still pursue, when, and so far as it will admit; it now employing but a small part of their present Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers Stock.</p>
            <p>This Company, depending on their said Charter and Act of Parliament to be their just Right so invested in them by Law, were encouraged, not only to Pay with Interest many Thousand Pounds of Debts contracted by their Predecessors, but have been at great Expences of Ambassadors, and other incident Charges for the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary support of their said Trade. And forasmuch as this Bill which hath been Read once in this House, is the same <hi>Verbatim</hi> as that which upon a full Hearing in this House was in <hi>Feb.</hi> 1696. dismissed:</p>
            <p>Therefore humbly Pray they may be continued in their lawful Rights and Privileges, and that the Bill now depending in this Honourable House against them, may be dismiss'd, as the other was the last Sessions of this present Parliament.</p>
